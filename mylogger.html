<p>Instruction to use the bot:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I add some info?</li>
</ul>

<p>Movie: Inception
Movie is the tag and Inception is info, colon is the separator.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I add new tag?</li>
</ul>

<p>You don’t add tags separately. Just send message like above example, the left part of info becomes tag.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is tag case sensitive?</li>
</ul>

<p>No, it is not. So adding the same named tag in a different case will be considered as ONE tag and not different tags</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I see what I have already added?</li>
</ul>

<p>Just send L to list all. And L  to see info tagged to given tag name.</p>

<p>e.g L will give me all info added but
L movie will give me only info added to movie tag.</p>

<ul>
<li>Why do I see only recent 11 items?</li>
</ul>

<p>To make the message more readable by default we get recent 11 info. You can get more using below command.</p>

<p>L -L30 will give recent 30 info, like this you can give any number.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I undo what I have recently added?</li>
</ul>

<p>just send Undo, but you can not redo.</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I see all my tags?</li>
</ul>

<p>tags</p>

<ul>
<li>In a list of info something is not relevant any more, how do I archive it?</li>
</ul>

<p>This will be in 2 steps</p>

<p>1st list the info by L command</p>

<p>2nd send </p>

<p>Done -L index of that info</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I delete some info?</li>
</ul>

<p>This also in 2 steps. This can not be undone.</p>

<p>1st list the info by L command</p>

<p>2nd send </p>

<p>Delete -L index of that info</p>

<ul>
<li>What are options available in List(L) command?</li>
</ul>

<p>tag: Show info belongs to only that tag</p>

<p>-l number : To list that many number of info</p>

<p>-t : to show the tag it belongs to</p>

<p>-d: shows the date it was added</p>

<p>-a: shows info including the ones archived</p>

<p>-w text : To do a wildcard search of “text” on all info, when you don’t remember the tag. e.g L -w inception</p>
