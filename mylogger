Instruction to use the bot:

* How do I add some info?

Movie: Inception
Movie is the tag and Inception is info, colon is the separator.

* How do I add new tag?

You don’t add tags separately. Just send message like above example, the left part of info becomes tag.

* Is tag case sensitive?

No, it is not. So adding the same named tag in a different case will be considered as ONE tag and not different tags

* How do I see what I have already added?

Just send L to list all. And L <tagname> to see info tagged to given tag name.

e.g L will give me all info added but
L movie will give me only info added to movie tag.

* Why do I see only recent 11 items?

To make the message more readable by default we get recent 11 info. You can get more using below command.

L -L30 will give recent 30 info, like this you can give any number.

* How do I undo what I have recently added?

just send Undo, but you can not redo.
